Hi there! 👋 I'm Xihe Niu.  

**"The cell writes its diary in molecular ink — my code becomes its quill."**

## 🧠 Research Philosophy
I aim to develop AI-driven computational tools that reveal hidden biological narratives from complex data. My work sits at the exciting collision point where:
* Deep learning meets mass spectrometry.
* Algorithm design intersects post-translational modification discovery.
* Open-source tools empower omics research.

## 🎓 Education & Research Appointments
### Current Affiliation
🌟 Exciting to join the [Zou Lab](https://www.yilongzou-lab.com/) and [FeNNOmix Lab](https://www.fennomix.com/) at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) to explore "AI for Science"!
  * **Zou Lab** investigates lipid metabolism in development and disease, combining multi-scale biology to uncover new pathways and therapies for cancer and degeneration.
  * **FeNNOmix Lab** develops AI-driven computational tools to explore glycoproteomics, immunopeptidomics, and PTMomics, with a focus on virus-host interactions and disease mechanisms.

### Academic Background
🏛️ B.E. in Computer Science and Technology, [Shandong First Medical University](https://www.sdfmu.edu.cn/) (2021–2025)

## 🚀 Current Adventures
### 🌌 Decoding Cellular "Dark Matter"
*Next-gen PTM discovery tools at Zou Lab & FeNNOmix Lab*:
* Developing deep learning-based tools to uncover novel protein lipidations by integrating retention time shifts, diagnostic fragment ions (empirical & predicted), and open-/blind-search MS/MS pipelines for untargeted PTM discovery.
* Built an LC-MS/MS workflow for site-specific lipidation identification, automating detection of modification-specific spectral patterns and RT deviations, enabling igh-confidence annotation of known lipidations (e.g., S-palmitoylation, N-myristoylation).

### 🔬 Decoding Metastatic Metabolic “Cryptography”
*Metabolomics Profiling of Tumor Drug Response at Zou Lab*:
* Integrating metabolomics with transcriptomics/proteomics to identify metastasis-associated metabolic vulnerabilities.
* Correlating metabolic shifts with drug sensitivity assays and mapping critical metabolic pathways.

## 🌍 Beyond the Lab
* I like to document the world through both camera and journal - whether capturing the urban landscapes or the mountain streams. Each journey becomes a field study in cultural and natural phenomena.
* Badminton, swimming, and Go (Weiqi) - enjoying both intellectual and physical activities.

Hi there! üëã I'm Xihe Niu.

**Computational Biologist** | **AI Enthusiasts** | **Software Developer**

## üéì Education & Appointments
- **Bachelor of Computer Science** [Shandong First Medical University](https://www.sdfmu.edu.cn/) | 2021 - Present  
  ‚Ä¢ Prof. Changbin Yu - Bioinformatic  
  ‚Ä¢ Prof. Lanhua Zhang - AI  

- **Visiting Researcher** [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/) | 2024 - Present  
  ‚Ä¢ Prof. Yilong Zou ([Zou Lab](https://www.yilongzou-lab.com/)) - Metabolomics  
  ‚Ä¢ Prof. Wenfeng Zeng ([FeNNOMix Lab](https://fennomix.com/)) - AI  

## üî¨ Research Focus  
Developing *computational tools* to solve biological challenges in:  
- **Proteomics** (Developing AI-driven methods for accurate LC-MS/MS based identification of protein post-translational modifications). 
- **Metabolomics** (Investigating the relationship between drug sensitivity and metastatic potential in tumor cells).

## üèÜ Highlighted Projects
1. [AMHEL: Deep Learning-Based Depressive Sentiment Detection in Social Media Texts.](https://github.com/XiheNiu/AMHEL)
  - Developed a BiGRU + Multi-head Attention model using GloVe embeddings to analyze social media texts for mental health screening. Achieved 94% precision (AUC=0.91) by focusing on sentiment-rich keywords via attention mechanisms and optimizing with AdamW/label smoothing. Recognized with a national software copyright (2024SR1068492) and selected for China's College Computer Design Competition finals.
  - Developed under Prof. Lanhua Zhang at SDFMU & Manuscript in prep.
2. [IERC: An Ion Informativity-centric Paradigm for Spectral Matching.](https://github.com/XiheNiu/IERC_similarity)
   - Created an Ion Entropy and Rank-transformed spectral similarity (IERC) metric. By quantifying ion informativeness through fragmentation entropy and rank-transforming intensities, the approach enhances cross-instrument consistency while filtering noise. Validated on multiple MS platforms, it outperformed dot-product and Manhattan metrics, enabling more reliable small molecule characterization.
   - Developed under Prof. Changbin Yu at SDFMU & Manuscript in prep.
3. Novel Protein Lipidation Discovery. (Ongoing & Unpublished)
   - Developed an LC-MS/MS pipeline for accurate lipidation identification, automating detection of site-specific modification markers and retention time shifts. Using open-search and blind-search techniques, I have uncovered potential novel modifications while reliably characterizing known lipidations. Current work focuses on implementing deep learning models to predict spectral patterns of unknown PTMs, with subsequent experimental validation to expand identifiable modification types.
   - Developed under Prof. YiLong Zou and Wenfeng Zeng at WU.
